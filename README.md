# Etch-A-Sketch

## Introduction
An online interpretation of the popular children toy Etch-A-Sketch.
The main difference is the ability to jump to another spot on the drawing board without creating a line to the old spot.

The app allows the user to create accounts and to save drawings to a database with customization options for a drawing like size, and color themes.
Drawings of other users can be viewed, customized and saved to own accounts.
